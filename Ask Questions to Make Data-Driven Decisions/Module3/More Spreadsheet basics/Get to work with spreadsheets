Get to work with spreadsheets 
Data analysts spend a lot of time organizing data and performing calculations. There are lots of different tools to help them do just that, including spreadsheets. 

Here is an overview of a few of the major tasks. Imagine you work for a construction company. Your company needs your spreadsheet skills to analyze some data about 
their expenses, so you access the appropriate data and add it to your spreadsheet. 
What do you do with the data now that it's in your spreadsheet? 
Start by organizing your data with the task you've been given. For example, you might put your data in a pivot table. Pivot tables are  well-organized and very useful 
tables. 
Next,  filter the data in the pivot table. Sorting and filtering data is a common part of most jobs. This lets you focus only on the data you'll need for your analysis. 
In our example, maybe you only need the expenses for a certain time frame, like the last three months. After you filter your data, you can perform some calculations 
to learn more about it. 
Maybe you need to find out which construction projects ended up costing the most money. This is where formulas and functions are really handy. We'll talk about them 
in just a bit, but formulas and functions are great for doing some quick math, especially once you run out of fingers and toes to count on. 
Now you've seen some of the ways data analysts are using spreadsheets in their day-to-day work for a lot of different tasks, including organizing their data and 
making calculations. Before you know it we'll have you working in your spreadsheets.
